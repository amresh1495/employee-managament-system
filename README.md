# Employee Management System

## Objective
Develop a command-line Employee Management System using Python that enables a company to manage information about their employees and departments using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and efficient data structures.

## Features

### Employee Class
- Create an Employee class with attributes for name, ID, title, and department.
- Include a method to display employee details.
- Implement a string representation method that returns the employee's name and ID.

### Department Class
- Create a Department class with attributes for department name and a list of employees.
- Include methods to add an employee, remove an employee, and list all employees in the department.

### Data Structure for Company
- Use a dictionary to represent the company, with department names as keys and Department objects as values.
- Implement functions to add a department, remove a department, and display all departments.

### User Interaction
- Write a function that prints a menu for the user to interact with the Employee Management System (e.g., Add Employee, Remove Employee, Display Department, etc.).
- The user should be able to add employees to departments, remove employees, and view department details.

### Data Persistence (Optional)
- Save the company data to a file and load it back into the system on startup. (This can be plain text, JSON, or any other format you deem appropriate.)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the main script using `python main.py` or the appropriate command.

## Usage

2. (Optional) Save and load company data using the provided functionality.
